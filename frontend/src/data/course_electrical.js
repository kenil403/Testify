              answer: "0 degrees",
              explanation: "At resonance, the inductive and capacitive reactances cancel each other out, leaving only the resistance. The circuit behaves as if it were purely resistive, so the voltage and current are in phase." },

              explanation: "In a purely reactive circuit (only L or only C), the phase angle between voltage and current is 90 degrees. The power factor is the cosine of this angle, and the cosine of 90 degrees is zero. This means no true power is consumed; energy is just stored and returned by the reactive component." }

              answer: "Electromagnetic induction",
              explanation: "Generators work by moving a conductor through a magnetic field (or moving a field past a conductor). This relative motion causes a change in magnetic flux, which, according to Faraday's Law, induces an EMF (voltage) in the conductor." },

              answer: "Diodes and transistors",
              explanation: "Ohm's law (V=IR) applies to linear, bilateral components where the resistance is constant. Diodes and transistors are non-linear devices; their current-voltage relationship is not a straight line, so their \"resistance\" is not constant." },

              answer: "120 V",
              explanation: "For a sine wave, V_rms = V_peak / sqrt(2). So, V_rms = 170 V / 1.414 is approximately 120 V. This is the standard relationship for household voltage in North America." },

              answer: "Step-down transformer",
              explanation: "A turns ratio is often given as Np:Ns (primary to secondary). A 2:1 ratio means the primary has twice as many turns as the secondary, so the voltage will be stepped down by a factor of 2." },

              options: ["Oscillates before settling", "Is very fast with no overshoot", "Approaches the final value slowly and without oscillation", "Is unstable and grows indefinitely"],
              answer: "Approaches the final value slowly and without oscillation",
              explanation: "An overdamped system has a high level of damping (large R). When subjected to a step input, it moves slowly towards its final steady-state value without ever crossing it." },

              answer: "At a maximum",
              explanation: "At resonance, the impedance of a series RLC circuit is at its minimum value (equal to R). Since the voltage is constant, a minimum impedance results in a maximum current flow according to Ohm's Law (I = V/Z)." },

              answer: "Utilizes both half-cycles of the AC input",
              explanation: "A half-wave rectifier discards one half of the AC waveform, while a full-wave rectifier inverts it, using the entire input waveform to produce the DC output. This results in a higher average voltage and less ripple." },

              options: ["Current", "Voltage", "Resistance", "Frequency"],
              answer: "Voltage",
              explanation: "The voltage across a capacitor is proportional to the stored charge. Since it takes time for charge to accumulate, the voltage cannot change instantaneously." },

              answer: "Power factor",
              explanation: "This is the definition of power factor. PF = P / S = (True Power in Watts) / (Apparent Power in VA). It is a measure of the circuit's efficiency." },

              answer: "Vector sum of the resistor and capacitor voltages",
              explanation: "Because the voltage across the resistor (VR) and the voltage across the capacitor (VC) are 90 degrees out of phase, they must be added as vectors using the Pythagorean theorem: V_total = sqrt(VR squared + VC squared)." },

              answer: "Band-pass filter",
              explanation: "A band-pass filter has a lower cutoff frequency and an upper cutoff frequency. It attenuates frequencies below the lower cutoff and above the upper cutoff, creating a \"passband\" in between." },

              answer: "Voltage-controlled voltage source",
              explanation: "The output voltage of an op-amp is a function of the differential input voltage (V+ minus V-). Its output acts as a near-perfect voltage source, making it a VCVS." },

              answer: "Rate at which the transient response decays",
              explanation: "A smaller time constant means the transient part of the response will decay to zero more quickly. A larger time constant means the circuit takes longer to reach its steady state." },

              answer: "The system is a 4-wire system and the load is unbalanced",
              explanation: "The two-wattmeter method works correctly for 3-wire systems under all conditions. However, if there is a neutral wire (a 4-wire system) and the load is unbalanced, a current can flow in the neutral wire that is not measured by the two wattmeters, leading to an incorrect reading." },

              answer: "Is the same for current flowing in either direction",
              explanation: "A resistor is a classic example of a bilateral element; its resistance is the same regardless of the direction of current. A diode is unilateral because it allows current to flow easily in only one direction." },

              answer: "Much greater than 1",
              explanation: "Ferromagnetic materials (like iron, nickel, and cobalt) are strongly attracted to a magnetic field. Their ability to concentrate magnetic flux results in relative permeabilities that can be in the hundreds or thousands." },

              answer: "Quadrupled",
              explanation: "The inductance of a coil is proportional to the square of the number of turns (L is proportional to N squared). Therefore, doubling the number of turns will multiply the inductance by a factor of four." },

              answer: "Oscillate",
              explanation: "The response of a first-order circuit (simple RC or RL) is always a non-oscillatory exponential rise or decay. Oscillations can only occur in circuits that are second-order or higher (containing both L and C)." },

              answer: "Constant at all times",
              explanation: "Although the power in each individual phase is pulsating, the sum of the instantaneous powers of all three phases is a constant, non-pulsating value. This is a major advantage for running large motors smoothly." },

              answer: "Inductors and capacitors",
              explanation: "Resistors dissipate energy as heat. Inductors store energy in a magnetic field, and capacitors store energy in an electric field. These are the two energy storage elements in electrical circuits." },

              answer: "Reciprocal of the vector sum of the branch admittances",
              explanation: "For parallel AC circuits, it is much easier to work with admittances (Y = 1/Z). The total admittance is the vector sum of the individual branch admittances (Yt = Y1 + Y2 + ...), and the total impedance is the reciprocal of this sum (Zt = 1/Yt)." },

              answer: "Dynamo",
              explanation: "A dynamo is a DC generator. It works on the same principle of electromagnetic induction as an alternator but uses a commutator to mechanically rectify the AC voltage produced in the rotating armature into a DC output." },

              answer: "10 A",
              explanation: "For an ideal transformer, the current ratio is the inverse of the turns ratio: Is / Ip = Np / Ns. Therefore, Is = Ip * (Np / Ns) = 2 A * 5 = 10 A." },

              answer: "Increase to a maximum at resonance and then decrease",
              explanation: "At very low and very high frequencies, the impedance is large (due to C and L, respectively), so the current is low. At the resonant frequency, the impedance is at its minimum, so the current reaches its peak value." },

              answer: "High current and low voltage",
              explanation: "A short circuit creates a very low impedance path. According to Ohm's law, this low impedance allows a very large fault current to flow. This large current flowing through the system's inherent impedance causes the voltage at the fault location to drop to a very low value." }

              answer: "The very beginning of the charging process (t = 0+)",
              explanation: "At the instant the switch is closed, the uncharged capacitor acts like a short circuit, allowing the maximum possible current (limited only by the resistance, I = V/R) to flow. The current then decays exponentially." },

              answer: "Less than the smallest resistance in the combination",
              explanation: "Adding more parallel paths for the current always makes it easier for the total current to flow. Therefore, the overall equivalent resistance is always reduced and will be smaller than the value of any single branch resistor." },

              answer: "5 A",
              explanation: "This is the definition of the RMS value. The RMS (Root Mean Square) value of an AC current is the equivalent DC current that would dissipate the same amount of power (heat) in a given resistor." },

              answer: "Frequency is increased",
              explanation: "The impedance is Z = sqrt(R squared + XC squared). As frequency increases, the capacitive reactance (XC) decreases. Since XC is one of the terms in the sum, the overall impedance Z will also decrease." },

              answer: "Ampere-second",
              explanation: "Since current is the rate of flow of charge (I = Q/t), charge is the product of current and time (Q = I * t). Therefore, 1 Coulomb = 1 Ampere * 1 second." },

              options: ["Inductor", "Capacitor", "Resistor", "Source voltage"],
              answer: "Resistor",
              explanation: "The resistor is the only element in a standard RLC circuit that dissipates energy. The amount of resistance relative to the reactive components determines how quickly the oscillations in the circuit are damped out." },
            { id: 57, question: "A balanced three-phase load is one in which all three phases have:",
              options: ["Equal impedances", "The same voltage", "The same current", "A power factor of unity"],
              answer: "Equal impedances",
              explanation: "This is the definition of a balanced load. If a balanced three-phase voltage is applied to a load with three identical phase impedances, then the resulting phase currents will also be identical (and balanced)." },
            { id: 58, question: "The property of a circuit that opposes changes in voltage is:",
              options: ["Resistance", "Inductance", "Capacitance", "Reluctance"],
              answer: "Capacitance",
              explanation: "A capacitor stores energy in an electric field created by voltage. Because it takes time to build up or reduce this stored energy, a capacitor opposes any attempt to change the voltage across it instantaneously." },
            { id: 59, question: "In the two-wattmeter method, the total power is the:",
              options: ["Product of the two readings", "Algebraic sum of the two readings", "Vector sum of the two readings", "Average of the two readings"],
              answer: "Algebraic sum of the two readings",
              explanation: "The total three-phase power is simply P_total = W1 + W2. It is an algebraic sum, meaning if one wattmeter reads negative, its value is subtracted from the other." },
            { id: 60, question: "Apparent power is so named because it:",
              options: ["Is the power that appears to be consumed by the load", "Is the true power of the circuit", "Has no real-world effect", "Can only be seen with special instruments"],
              answer: "Is the power that appears to be consumed by the load",
              explanation: "Apparent power (S = V * I) is the power that the source \"thinks\" it is delivering, based on the total voltage and current. However, due to the phase angle, not all of this apparent power is converted to true, useful work." }
