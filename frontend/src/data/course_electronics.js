              answer: "Ratio of the modulating signal amplitude to the carrier signal amplitude",
              explanation: "The modulation index (m) determines the extent of amplitude variation. For AM, it should be kept less than or equal to 1 to avoid distortion (overmodulation)." },

              answer: "Inductor",
              explanation: "An inductor's impedance (XL = 2πfL) increases with frequency. Therefore, it presents a high impedance to high-frequency signals, effectively 'choking' them off, while offering low impedance to DC and low-frequency AC." },

              answer: "Orientation of the electric field vector's oscillation over time",
              explanation: "An EM wave can be linearly polarized (E-field oscillates along a straight line), circularly polarized (E-field vector rotates in a circle), or elliptically polarized." },

              answer: "Inverter",
              explanation: "The rectifier charges the battery from the AC mains, and the inverter takes over during a power failure, converting the DC voltage from the battery back into a stable AC voltage to power the connected equipment." },

              answer: "Inverting input terminal is at approximately ground potential",
              explanation: "Due to the op-amp's extremely high open-loop gain, when used in a negative feedback configuration (like an inverting amplifier with the non-inverting input grounded), the op-amp will do whatever it can to make the voltage difference between its inputs zero. This forces the inverting input to the same potential as the non-inverting input, which is ground." },

              options: ["Multiplexer", "Decoder", "Counter", "Full Adder"],
              answer: "Counter",
              explanation: "A sequential circuit's output depends not only on the present inputs but also on the past sequence of inputs, meaning it has memory. Counters and flip-flops are sequential circuits. Multiplexers, decoders, and adders are combinational circuits." },

              answer: "Poles",
              explanation: "The root locus is a graphical method for analyzing the stability and transient response of a control system. The location of the closed-loop poles determines the system's behavior, and the plot traces their movement from the open-loop poles to the open-loop zeros as the system gain increases from 0 to infinity." },

              answer: "A single antenna to be used for both transmitting and receiving simultaneously",
              explanation: "A duplexer is a three-port device, typically a set of filters, that isolates the high-power transmitter from the sensitive receiver, preventing the transmitter from damaging the receiver while they share an antenna, as in a cellular phone or radar system." },

              answer: "Energy of a signal in the time domain to its energy in the frequency domain",
              explanation: "Parseval's theorem is a statement of the conservation of energy. It states that the total energy calculated by integrating the squared magnitude of the signal in the time domain is equal to the total energy calculated by integrating the squared magnitude of its Fourier transform (spectrum) in the frequency domain." },

              options: ["Reduce the collector current", "Increase the emitter current", "Allow most charge carriers from the emitter to pass through to the collector", "Increase the input impedance"],
              answer: "Allow most charge carriers from the emitter to pass through to the collector",
              explanation: "Making the base thin reduces the chance that minority carriers injected from the emitter will recombine with majority carriers in the base. This ensures a high transport factor and thus a high current gain (beta)." },

              answer: "Provides the address of its own service routine to the processor",
              explanation: "With a vectored interrupt, the interrupting device itself tells the CPU where to find the appropriate interrupt service routine (ISR). This is faster than a non-vectored system where the CPU has to poll all devices to find out which one generated the interrupt." },

              options: ["Linear voltage regulator", "Switching voltage regulator", "Shunt voltage regulator", "Current regulator"],
              answer: "Linear voltage regulator",
              explanation: "This is a common and simple regulator design where a control element, such as a BJT or MOSFET, is placed in series with the load. The control element acts as a variable resistor, dropping the excess voltage to maintain a constant output voltage." },
            { id: 49, question: "The 'Smith chart' is a graphical tool used in RF engineering primarily for:",
              options: ["Analyzing stability in control systems", "Simplifying Boolean algebra", "Solving transmission line and impedance matching problems", "Designing digital filters"],
              answer: "Solving transmission line and impedance matching problems",
              explanation: "The Smith chart is a polar plot that maps the entire right-half of the complex impedance plane into a circle. It allows for rapid graphical calculation of parameters like SWR, reflection coefficient, and the effects of adding matching components." },
            { id: 50, question: "A 'transducer' is a device that:",
              options: ["Amplifies electronic signals", "Converts energy from one form to another", "Regulates voltage", "Stores electrical charge"],
              answer: "Converts energy from one form to another",
              explanation: "Transducers are at the heart of all measurement and instrumentation systems. Examples include a microphone (sound to electrical), a loudspeaker (electrical to sound), and a thermocouple (heat to electrical)." },
            { id: 51, question: "An 'opto-triac' (or phototriac) is used to:",
              options: ["Provide an optically isolated way to trigger a high-power TRIAC", "Generate laser light", "Measure the power of an optical signal", "Act as a very fast optical switch"],
              answer: "Provide an optically isolated way to trigger a high-power TRIAC",
              explanation: "It combines an LED and a light-activated TRIAC in one package. A low-voltage control signal can turn on the LED, which in turn triggers the internal phototriac. This provides a safe, isolated interface between a low-power control circuit (like a microcontroller) and a high-power AC load." },
            { id: 52, question: "The 'dynamic range' of a system, such as an amplifier or receiver, is the ratio of the:",
              options: ["Bandwidth to the center frequency", "Maximum possible output to the minimum possible output", "Maximum undistorted signal level to the minimum detectable signal level (noise floor)", "Input impedance to the output impedance"],
              answer: "Maximum undistorted signal level to the minimum detectable signal level (noise floor)",
              explanation: "Dynamic range, usually expressed in dB, defines the range of signal amplitudes that a system can process effectively, from the quietest to the loudest, without significant distortion or being lost in noise." },
            { id: 53, question: "In digital logic, a 'don't care' condition means that:",
              options: ["The input condition will never occur", "The output can be either high or low for a given input, as it is not critical", "The logic gate is not functioning", "The input is floating"],
              answer: "The output can be either high or low for a given input, as it is not critical",
              explanation: "\"Don't care\" conditions arise from input combinations that are either invalid or whose output state doesn't matter. They can be very useful in logic simplification, as they can be assigned a value of either 0 or 1 to create larger groupings in a K-map, leading to a simpler final circuit." },
            { id: 54, question: "The 'damping ratio' (zeta, ζ) in a second-order control system determines the:",
              options: ["Final steady-state value of the response", "Speed of the response", "Nature of the transient response (e.g., underdamped, overdamped)", "Frequency of oscillation"],
              answer: "Nature of the transient response (e.g., underdamped, overdamped)",
              explanation: "A damping ratio of ζ < 1 results in an underdamped (oscillatory) response. ζ = 1 is critically damped (fastest response without overshoot). ζ > 1 is overdamped (slow and sluggish response)." },
            { id: 55, question: "The 'Code Division Multiple Access' (CDMA) technique allows multiple users to share a channel by:",
              options: ["Assigning them different time slots", "Assigning them different frequency bands", "Assigning them unique spreading codes", "Assigning them different polarization"],
              answer: "Assigning them unique spreading codes",
              explanation: "In CDMA, each user's signal is multiplied by a unique pseudo-random code that spreads it over a wide bandwidth. The receiver uses the same code to despread and recover the intended signal, while all other users' signals appear as noise and are rejected." },
            { id: 56, question: "The 'beat frequency oscillator' (BFO) in a receiver is required to demodulate which type of signal?",
              options: ["FM", "AM (standard)", "CW (Morse code) and SSB", "PCM"],
              answer: "CW (Morse code) and SSB",
              explanation: "Continuous Wave (CW) and Single-Sideband (SSB) signals have their carriers suppressed. The BFO provides a locally generated carrier in the receiver that is mixed with the incoming signal to produce an audible tone (for CW) or to restore the suppressed carrier and make the voice intelligible (for SSB)." },
            { id: 57, question: "A 'patch antenna' is a type of antenna that is:",
              options: ["Very large and used for low frequencies", "Made from a long wire", "Low-profile and can be mounted on a flat surface", "Omnidirectional"],
              answer: "Low-profile and can be mounted on a flat surface",
              explanation: "Microstrip patch antennas consist of a metallic patch on a dielectric substrate backed by a ground plane. They are lightweight, inexpensive to manufacture, and can be easily integrated into devices like mobile phones, GPS receivers, and Wi-Fi routers." },
            { id: 58, question: "The 'ionosphere' is a layer of the Earth's atmosphere that is important for radio communication because it can:",
              options: ["Absorb all radio waves", "Refract high-frequency (HF) radio waves, enabling long-distance communication", "Scatter microwave signals", "Block signals from satellites"],
              answer: "Refract high-frequency (HF) radio waves, enabling long-distance communication",
              explanation: "The ionosphere, ionized by solar radiation, acts like a mirror for radio waves in the HF band (roughly 3-30 MHz), allowing signals to be bounced around the curve of the Earth for intercontinental \"skywave\" communication." },
            { id: 59, question: "A 'flag register' in a microprocessor contains:",
              options: ["The main data being processed", "The memory address of the next instruction", "Status bits that indicate the result of arithmetic and logic operations", "The address of the top of the stack"],
              answer: "Status bits that indicate the result of arithmetic and logic operations",
              explanation: "The flag register contains individual bits that are set or cleared based on the outcome of the last ALU operation. These flags include the Zero flag, Carry flag, Sign flag, Parity flag, etc., and are used for conditional branching in programs." },
            { id: 60, question: "'Aliasing' in a sampled data system occurs when the:",
              options: ["Sampling rate is too high", "Signal contains no high frequencies", "Sampling rate is less than twice the highest frequency in the signal", "Quantization is too coarse"],
              answer: "Sampling rate is less than twice the highest frequency in the signal",
              explanation: "When the sampling rate is too low (violating the Nyquist theorem), high-frequency components in the original signal \"fold down\" and masquerade as lower frequencies in the sampled data, causing irreversible distortion." }
