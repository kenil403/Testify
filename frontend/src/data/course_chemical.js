                      answer: "The value of a disturbance variable before it affects the process",
                      explanation: "Feedforward control is proactive. It measures a potential disturbance (like a change in feed flow rate) and makes a corrective change to a manipulated variable to cancel out the disturbance's effect before it can cause an error in the controlled variable." },

                      answer: "Actual overall reaction rate to the rate that would occur if the entire interior of the pellet were exposed to the external reactant concentration",
                      explanation: "This factor accounts for the limitations on the reaction rate caused by the diffusion of reactants into the pores of the catalyst pellet. An effectiveness factor less than 1 indicates pore diffusion limitations." },

                      answer: "Lowest temperature at which it can vaporize to form an ignitable mixture in air",
                      explanation: "The flash point is a key safety parameter. A liquid with a low flash point is considered a greater fire hazard." },

                      explanation: "Permeability is related to the interconnectedness of the pores within the refractory and is an important property when considering penetration by molten metals, slags, or gases." },

                      answer: "Vapor",
                      explanation: "A vapor is a gas that can be liquefied by the application of pressure alone, without lowering its temperature, as long as it is below its critical temperature." },

                      answer: "The transition regime just after the critical Reynolds number",
                      explanation: "At a critical Reynolds number (around 3x10^5), the boundary layer on the sphere becomes turbulent, which delays separation and causes a sudden, sharp drop in the drag coefficient. This is known as the \"drag crisis.\"" },

                      answer: "Co-current or parallel flow",
                      explanation: "In parallel flow, both fluids enter at one end and exit at the other, flowing in the same direction. This arrangement is less thermally efficient than counter-current flow." },

                      answer: "Hoppers and silos",
                      explanation: "The angle of repose is the steepest angle at which a pile of granular material is stable. It is used to design the cone angle of hoppers to ensure reliable gravity flow (mass flow or funnel flow)." },

                      answer: "Act as an anti-knock agent to increase the octane number",
                      explanation: "Tetraethyllead was a very effective octane booster, but it was phased out due to its toxicity and the environmental damage caused by lead emissions." },

                      answer: "To agglomerate fine powders into larger, more uniform granules",
                      explanation: "Granulation improves the handling, storage, and application properties of fertilisers by reducing dust, preventing caking, and ensuring a uniform distribution of nutrients." },

                      answer: "Forming a solid phase with a highly ordered internal structure",
                      explanation: "Crystallization is a powerful purification technique because the regular structure of a crystal tends to exclude impurities, leading to a very pure solid product." },

                      answer: "Higher heating value (HHV)",
                      explanation: "The HHV, or GHV, is the heat of combustion calculated assuming that the water produced in the combustion is fully condensed back to a liquid, thus recovering its latent heat of vaporization." },

                      answer: "Reaction rate to the bulk transport (convective) rate",
                      explanation: "It provides an estimate of the degree of conversion that can be achieved in a continuous flow reactor. A large Da number suggests a high conversion." },

                      answer: "Making the metal structure the cathode of an electrochemical cell",
                      explanation: "This is achieved either by attaching a more reactive \"sacrificial anode\" or by impressing an external DC current. This forces the structure to be the cathode, where reduction occurs, thus preventing it from corroding (oxidizing)." },

                      answer: "Rate of return when the net present value (NPV) of a project is zero",
                      explanation: "IRR is the discount rate at which the present value of all future cash flows from a project equals the initial investment. A project is generally considered acceptable if its IRR is greater than the company's required rate of return." },

                      answer: "Half of the atoms in a sample to decay",
                      explanation: "Radioactive decay is a first-order process, meaning the half-life is a constant, characteristic property of each isotope, regardless of the amount present." },

                      answer: "Required to bear a structural load at high temperatures",
                      explanation: "Creep is the slow deformation of a material under a sustained load at elevated temperatures. Refractories used in arches, walls, and piers must have good creep resistance to prevent sagging and failure over time." },

                      answer: "Conservation of mass",
                      explanation: "For steady, incompressible flow, the continuity equation simplifies to A1V1 = A2V2, meaning the product of the cross-sectional area and the average velocity is constant along a pipe, so the flow rate is constant." },

                      answer: "High-strength, low-alloy (HSLA) steel",
                      explanation: "HSLA steels are designed to provide better mechanical properties and greater resistance to atmospheric corrosion than conventional carbon steels, allowing for stronger yet lighter vessels." },

                      answer: "Alumina and silica, with a high degree of porosity",
                      explanation: "The high porosity traps air, which has a very low thermal conductivity. This makes insulating firebricks excellent for reducing heat loss but gives them lower strength and density compared to hard refractories." },

                      options: ["The release of toxic heavy metals into a waterway", "The enrichment of a body of water with nutrients, especially nitrogen and phosphorus", "An increase in the temperature of a body of water", "The presence of plastic waste"],
                      answer: "The enrichment of a body of water with nutrients, especially nitrogen and phosphorus",
                      explanation: "This over-enrichment leads to excessive growth of algae (algal blooms). When the algae die and decompose, they consume large amounts of dissolved oxygen, creating hypoxic \"dead zones\" where fish and other aquatic life cannot survive." }
